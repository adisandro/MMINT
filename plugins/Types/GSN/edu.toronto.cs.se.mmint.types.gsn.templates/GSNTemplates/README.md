## GSN Templates

A collection of templates to use in GSN assurance cases.

### Formal Strategies

Formally-defined strategy decompositions.

1. **Property Decomposition:**
allows users to formalize safety case goals as logical properties over a system model by selecting from a catalogue of property templates, validate these formalized strategies, and attach a formal proof artifact to the corresponding assurance case.

2. **Domain Decomposition:**
allows users to specify a partition of a safety goal's domain into subdomains, supporting numeric intervals and enumerations.
